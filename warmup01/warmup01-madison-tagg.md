Cooking Recipe - Spicy Caramel Popcorn
======================================

![Spicy Caramel Popcorn](/Users/madisontagg/Desktop/spicy-caramel-popcorn1.jpg)

This recipe is perfect for a **cold winter** day. Depending on your preference of heat and love for peanuts, the amount of cayenne pepper and peanuts can vary.

### Ingredients:

-   nonstick cooking spray
-   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1/2 cup popcorn kernels
-   2 cups salted peanuts (*optional*)
-   1 1/2 baking soda
-   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (*optional*)
-   3 cups sugar
-   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 tablespoon kosher or coarse sea salt

### Special Kitchen Tools:

-   two large rubber spatulas
-   mixing bowls (very large one and small one)
-   two large baking sheets
-   two saucepan with lid
-   Storage containers

### Steps of the Recipe:

1.  Lightly coat two large rubber spatulas, the large mixing bowl and two large baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray or a thin slick of oil.
2.  In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
3.  Add the popcorn kernels, cover and keep the saucepan moving until all of the kernels have popped (about 5 minutes). Transfer popcorn to the large mixing bowl covered in the cooking spay or oil.
4.  In a small bowl, whisk the baking soda and cayenne pepper.
5.  In another saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, salt and 1/2 cup of water. Cook over high heat, without stirring, until the mixture becomes a light golden-yellow caramel (about 10 to 14 minutes).
6.  Remove the heat to the saucepan and carefully whisk in the baking-soda mixture.
7.  Immediately pour the caramel mixture over the popcorn and don't fuss if it doesn't all come out of the pot. Working quickly and carefully, use the prepared spatulas to toss the caramel and popcorn together.
8.  Spread the popcorn onto the baking sheets and quickly separate them into small pieces while still warm. Cool to room temperature (about 15 minutes) then store into storage containers.

Euclidean Distance:
===================

### Definition:

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the legth of the **line segment** connecting them $\\overline{pq}$. In **Cartesian coordinates**, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Eucliedean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the **Pythagorean formula**.

$$d(p, q) = d(q, p) = {\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\dots + (q\_n-p\_n)^2}}$$
$$ ={\\sqrt{ \\sum\_{i=1}^n(q\_i - p\_i)^2}}$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a **Euclidean vector**. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$$ ||p|| = {\\sqrt{(p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\dots + p\_n^2)}} = {\\sqrt{p \\cdot p}} $$

Where the last expression involves the **dot product**.

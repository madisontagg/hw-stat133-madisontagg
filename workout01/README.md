Clear Description of HW:


2. Data:
  -Download the Data
  -Data Dictionary:

3. Data Preparation:
  -create an R Script files named make-shots-data-script.R
  -Include a title, description, inputs and outputs.
  -add column name to imported data frame.
  -change the original values of shot_made_flag.
  -Add column minute containing the minute number where a shot occured.
  -Used sink() to send the summary to the output.
  -used the row binding function to join the tables into one called global_Table.
  -export this table as a csv files called shots-data.csv to the folder data.

**"The purpose of this assignment is threefold: 1) From the logistical point of view, this assignment will give you the opportunity to start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub. 2) From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, you will be producing so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations. 3) From the report/communication standpoint, you will have to produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative."**
